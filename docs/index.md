# `rgba` - reasonably good bluetooth audio

The `rgba` is a tiny (41x20mm PCB), extremely high fidelity Bluetooth audio receiver meant to attach inline to the cord of
a pair of IEMs. It aims to provide as high quality audio as possible while retaining reasonable battery life and
its small form factor. For more information, see the [project README](https://github.com/termhn/rgba).
